✅ 1. Initialize the index
let slideIndex = 0;
This variable keeps track of which slide is currently being shown.

It starts at 0, and will be incremented in each cycle of the slideshow.

✅ 2. Call the function to start the slideshow

slideShow();
This runs the slideShow() function immediately after the script is loaded, kicking off the automatic slideshow loop.

✅ 3. Define the slideshow function

function slideShow(){
This function handles the logic of hiding all slides, showing the current one, and highlighting the corresponding dot.

✅ 4. Get references to the slides and dots

const slides = document.getElementsByClassName("slides");
const dots = document.getElementsByClassName('dot');
slides: This is an array-like object containing all elements with class slides (each image slide).

dots: This contains all dot elements, usually small circles under the slideshow that represent the current position.

✅ 5. Hide all slides
js
Copy
Edit
for(let i = 0; i < slides.length; i++){
    slides[i].style.display = 'none';
}
This loop hides all slides by setting display: none.

Only one slide will be shown at a time.

✅ 6. Move to the next slide
js
Copy
Edit
slideIndex++;
if(slideIndex > slides.length){ slideIndex = 1; }
Increases the slideIndex by 1.

If it exceeds the number of slides, it wraps around to 1 to create an infinite loop.

❗ You use slideIndex - 1 later (because arrays are 0-indexed), so you must start from 1 here.

✅ 7. Deactivate all dots
js
Copy
Edit
for(let i = 0; i < dots.length; i++){
    dots[i].classList.remove("active");
}
Removes the active class from all dots, so they aren't highlighted anymore.

✅ 8. Show the current slide and highlight the dot
js
Copy
Edit
slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = 'block';
dots[slideIndex-1].classList.add("active");
Shows the current slide.

Highlights the corresponding dot by adding the active class.

slideIndex - 1 is used because arrays start at 0 but you incremented slideIndex to start at 1.

✅ 9. Schedule the next slideshow update
js
Copy
Edit
setTimeout(slideShow, 2000);
Calls slideShow() again after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

This creates an automatic slideshow loop.

✅ Overall Flow:
Hide all slides.

Move to the next slide.

Deactivate all dots.

Show one slide and highlight one dot.

Repeat every 2 seconds.
